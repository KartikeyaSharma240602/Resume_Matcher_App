# Resume_Matcher_App
A Python-based tool to analyze and optimize resume-job description compatibility. This project uses PyPDF2 to extract text from resumes, spaCy for NLP-based keyword extraction, and a scoring algorithm to calculate match percentages. It also suggests improvements by identifying missing keywords in the resume.
